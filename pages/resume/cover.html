                    <p>Dear Smartsheet WorkApps Team,</p>

                    <p>
                        I am writing to express my interest in the Software Engineer Intern position you will offer this summer. As the head of a small design team, I applied practical front-end design and development experience to create marketable, lead-converting websites. I have a few years of experience developing backend software and continue to grow as a developer through my collegiate education.

                    <p>
                        My goal at Smartsheet is to deliver the same quality of software that I have developed in the last few years to the clients of the WorkApps Team. I know what it takes to complete the lifecycle that begins with the loosely formed yet emphatic ideas of clients and ends with those clients feeling satisfied and confidently directing potential leads to their website. I am a reliable professional that maintained hundreds of client relationships over weekslong development periods in some cases, managing all the details of their designs and constantly communicating updates to them. I am also comfortable working on development teams to build robust and user-friendly applications.

                        <li>maintaining 2000+ websites for teams of Loan Officers and Mortgage Brokers</li>
                        <li>maintaining a system-wide CSS library for use by all developers</li>
                        <li>overseeing the supplementary training of one other front-end developer</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <p>
                        As the world transfers more and more of its computing to cloud-based services, it is exciting to me that the WorkApps team is using Amazon Web Services. I have some exposure to these features, specifically Amplify and Lambda. I am also confident that I am a good fit for this position because the programming languages that I am most comfortable with are JavaScript and Java. I aim to bring my skills to the WorkApps team to develop maintainable and presentable products. Please let me know how I can accomplish this.
